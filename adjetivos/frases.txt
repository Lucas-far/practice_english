their art wasn't good
my friend grew up with me
she will not have to cut her nails
the result was clear and unfair
I will be angry due to my life
she could have natural food
you have issues to study
he cannot see my eyes, likely sight issue
I didn't have free time to study
I worked in a community, it was not negative
I stood hours out of home
I have new reasons to change
there was a strange men next to the house
The child could not see through the window
She will not be dirty, she has some studies to do
culture is a cultural word, but it isn't pretty
I do not have obnoxiously friends 
I will not have a special day, because of the war
